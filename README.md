# Tidal Regear Management System
This is only the front-end repository, the backend repository will be available as a link here when it is available.

## About
This project will allow guild officers to manage the guild's regear system.

### Approved users will be able to do the following:

* Specify the minimum IP and tier equivalency for a piece of gear or a full build.
* Approve/Deny/Delete individual regear requests.
* View data visualizations for the number of pending and rejected regears as well as data about how many of each piece
  of gear are currently owed to members.

### Regular guild members will be able to:

* View all currently pending regears for the guild.
* Search for their character and view only their regear requests.
* If a player's request is denied, they will be able to contact a guild officer to dispute the rejected request.
