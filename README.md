# Tidal Regear Management System
React Frontend for the Tidal Regear Management System
<br>
[Deployed App](https://tidal-regears-frontend.vercel.app)

You may view the app in two different ways:
1. As a regular user (guild member) with limited permissions.
2. As an admin with the ability to create new builds and approve/reject requests.

To log in as an admin, use the following credentials:
Username: Cynical
Password: Test

## Project Goals
The number one goal with this project was to eliminate the manual entry of code and management of documents that go into managing a guild's regear system.
I set out to create a smooth and seamless application that works in conjuction with the Albion Player Info application ([repo here](https://github.com/MatthewGammon/Albion-Player-Info), [Live application](https://albion-player-info.vercel.app/home))
to create and manage builds and regear requests. 

## Key Functionality
An guild officer with sufficient admin perms will be able to:
* Create a new build from a form that contains all of the weapons and armor in the game
* Edit and Delete created builds
* View all currently pending regear requests that have been submitted by guild members
* Approve or Reject regear requests

A regular user will be able to:
* Register an account and log in
* View information about the guild (useful for new and potential members)
* View requirements for joining the guild as well as requirements for getting an approved regear request
* View all builds that have been approved and created by the guild officers/admin
